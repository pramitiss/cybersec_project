In the code, various Python libraries for data analysis, machine learning, and visualization are utilized. Below is a breakdown of each tool and how it contributes to the code.
1. Pandas (pd)

    Purpose: Pandas is widely used for data handling and transformation, offering structures like DataFrames that organize data in tabular form.
    Usage: In this code, pd.read_csv() loads data from a CSV file into a DataFrame, making it easier to manipulate, filter, and clean the dataset. Later, pd.DataFrame() organizes packet information extracted from a .pcap file.

2. NumPy (np)

    Purpose: NumPy facilitates the handling of large numerical data sets through arrays and mathematical operations.
    Usage: np.inf and np.nan handle infinite and missing values, while np.array() creates a sample array for testing with the classifier, allowing for flexible numerical computations.

3. Scikit-Learn (sklearn)

    Purpose: This library offers a range of machine learning tools, including algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, and anomaly detection.
    Modules Used:
        IsolationForest: This algorithm is designed for anomaly detection and works by isolating observations within the feature space using random forests.
        RandomForestClassifier: A classification model built with multiple decision trees, which aggregates their predictions for robust classification, especially on complex data.
        StandardScaler: Scales features to have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1, aiding algorithms sensitive to feature scaling.
    Usage:
        Anomaly Detection: IsolationForest is used to detect unusual network activity in scaled data. Its predict() method classifies entries as either anomalies or normal.
        Classification: RandomForestClassifier is trained on parsed network data to classify it as normal or indicative of a DDoS attack. The model's performance is assessed using classification_report(), and train_test_split() divides the data for training and testing.

4. Scapy (scapy)

    Purpose: Scapy is used for network packet handling, popular in cybersecurity for analyzing and parsing network traffic.
    Usage: The rdpcap() function reads packet data from a .pcap file. For packets with an IP layer, data such as packet size and timing is extracted to create a dataset.

5. Matplotlib (plt)

    Purpose: Matplotlib provides tools to create various types of visualizations.
    Usage:
        Scatter Plot: Highlights anomalies in network data by plotting Flow_IAT_Min over time.
        Histograms and Line Plots: Visualize distributions and time-based trends in the dataset, helping to identify potential anomalies.

6. Seaborn (sns)

    Purpose: A visualization library based on Matplotlib, Seaborn creates visually appealing plots that help show data trends and distributions.
    Usage:
        Histplot: Displays packet size and duration distributions, with KDE for a smoother visualization.
        Line Plot: Tracks packet rate changes over time, identifying spikes or irregular patterns.

Code Workflow Summary

  1. Data Loading and Cleaning: The CSV file is loaded and preprocessed, removing infinite values.
  2. Anomaly Detection Using IsolationForest: An IsolationForest model identifies outliers, potentially representing unusual network activity.
  3. PCAP File Parsing Using Scapy: Network packets are analyzed to extract relevant data.
  4. Traffic Classification with RandomForest: The model is trained to classify traffic, assessing its accuracy afterward.
  5. Visualization: Data insights are visualized, making it easier to detect anomalies and observe traffic trends.

This blend of tools forms a comprehensive analysis pipeline from data preprocessing to anomaly detection and classification, enhanced with visual insights.
