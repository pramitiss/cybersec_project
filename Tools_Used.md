In the code, various Python libraries for data analysis, machine learning, and visualization are utilized. Below is a breakdown of each tool and how it contributes to the code.
1. Pandas (pd)

    Purpose: Pandas is widely used for data handling and transformation, offering structures like DataFrames that organize data in tabular form.
    Usage: In this code, pd.read_csv() loads data from a CSV file into a DataFrame, making it easier to manipulate, filter, and clean the dataset. Later, pd.DataFrame() organizes packet information extracted from a .pcap file.

2. NumPy (np)

    Purpose: NumPy facilitates the handling of large numerical data sets through arrays and mathematical operations.
    Usage: np.inf and np.nan handle infinite and missing values, while np.array() creates a sample array for testing with the classifier, allowing for flexible numerical computations.

3. Scikit-Learn (sklearn)

    Purpose: This library offers a range of machine learning tools, including algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, and anomaly detection.
    Modules Used:
     Isolation Forest: An algorithm for identifying anomalies in a dataset, Isolation Forest isolates observations in the feature space using random decision trees. Each data point is either classified as an inlier or an outlier based on its isolation score, making it effective for detecting anomalies in network traffic data.
   
    Random Forest Classifier: A versatile and powerful classification model based on an ensemble of decision trees. Each tree votes on the classification of data points, and the final prediction is determined by the majority vote, making it effective in classifying complex datasets and robust against overfitting.

    StandardScaler: Scales features to have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1, aiding algorithms sensitive to feature scaling.

    Usage:

    Anomaly Detection (Isolation Forest): IsolationForest is used to detect unusual network activity in the scaled data. Its predict() method classifies entries as either anomalies or normal data points, allowing for the identification of potential intrusions.
   
    Behavioural Analysis (Random Forest): RandomForestClassifier is trained on parsed network data to classify it as either normal or indicative of a DDoS attack. This model's performance is assessed using classification_report(), and train_test_split() divides the data into training and testing sets for accuracy evaluation.

4. Scapy (scapy)

    Purpose: Scapy is used for network packet handling, popular in cybersecurity for analyzing and parsing network traffic.
    Usage: The rdpcap() function reads packet data from a .pcap file. For packets with an IP layer, data such as packet size and timing is extracted to create a dataset.

5. Matplotlib (plt)

    Purpose: Matplotlib provides tools to create various types of visualizations.
    Usage:
        Scatter Plot: Highlights anomalies in network data by plotting Flow_IAT_Min over time.
        Histograms and Line Plots: Visualize distributions and time-based trends in the dataset, helping to identify potential anomalies.

6. Seaborn (sns)

    Purpose: A visualization library based on Matplotlib, Seaborn creates visually appealing plots that help show data trends and distributions.
    Usage:
        Histplot: Displays packet size and duration distributions, with KDE for a smoother visualization.
        Line Plot: Tracks packet rate changes over time, identifying spikes or irregular patterns.

Code Workflow Summary

  1. Data Loading and Cleaning: The CSV file is loaded and preprocessed, removing infinite values.
  2. Anomaly Detection Using IsolationForest: An IsolationForest model identifies outliers, potentially representing unusual network activity.
  3. PCAP File Parsing Using Scapy: Network packets are analyzed to extract relevant data.
  4. Traffic Classification with RandomForest: The model is trained to classify traffic, assessing its accuracy afterward.
  5. Visualization: Data insights are visualized, making it easier to detect anomalies and observe traffic trends.

This blend of tools forms a comprehensive analysis pipeline from data preprocessing to anomaly detection and classification, enhanced with visual insights.
